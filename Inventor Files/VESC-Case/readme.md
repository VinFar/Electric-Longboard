# Nice looking Case for VESC and other Components

This is is stylish Case for the VESC and other Compoments like Capacitors, Buck-Converters,Receiver etc...
It is about 35mm in height, therefore it looks very slim under the board.
For this Case I also scanned the Outlines from the bottom part of the Longboard, to make it look like a part of the Board.

I uploaded a [Clean Version](https://github.com/VinFar/Electric-Longboard/blob/master/Inventor%20Files/VESC-Case/Clean_Version_2.stl), in which is only the Case without any cutouts or holes, so you can edit it for yourself.
Also there is a ["USB Version"](https://github.com/VinFar/Electric-Longboard/blob/master/Inventor%20Files/VESC-Case/USB_Version_2.stl),
where i made some cutouts and holes for switches, Powercables, USB-Output etc...

Clean Version(no cutouts): [Clean_Version_2.stl](https://github.com/VinFar/Electric-Longboard/blob/master/Inventor%20Files/VESC-Case/Clean_Version_2.stl)

USB Version(with cutouts): [USB_Version_2.stl](https://github.com/VinFar/Electric-Longboard/blob/master/Inventor%20Files/VESC-Case/USB_Version_2.stl)

I think I will make a Version 3 in the near future with bigger dimensions and a more racy design.
