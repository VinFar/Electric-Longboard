# A small Case for two XT60 Male-Connecters

#### This is Case for two XT60 Connectors, which is placed in front of the Lipo Cases. Now I have a firm place to connect the batteries.
Also it gives a much cleaner look.

I have glued the Connecters with superglue into place and connected the batteries with copperwire and much solder.
Also i put the Mosfet for the LD Headlight in this case.

`Version2: Added a cage around the XT60 Connectors`
